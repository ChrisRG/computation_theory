# Theory of Computation

Organized for the Recurse Center Summer 1 (May-Aug) 2021 batch, this repository aims to provide resources for studying the theory of computation, using as a basis Tom Stuart's _Understanding Computation_ (O'Reilly 2012). Below you can find the general outline of the book's chapters with additional comments, references, and external resources to expand on the topic.

## Part 1 - Programs and Machines

### Semantics
* Operational Semantics
  * Small-step
  * Big-step
* Denotational Semantics
* Formal Semantics
* Parsing

### Finite Automata
* Deterministic Finite Automata
  - [Computerphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhiiia1_hC4) offering a useful analogy of DFAs and a parking meter that accepts coins  
* Nondeterministic Finite Automata
  - [Another Computerphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=528Jc3q86F8) about NFAs, with a discussion of Regular Expressions
* Regular Expressions
* Equivalence between DFAs and NFAs
  - [Short video introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8Uu0inPmU8&t=336s) to Regular Languages with graph showing equivalence

### Pushdown Automata
* Deterministic Pushdown Automata
* Nondeterministic Pushdown Automata
* Parsing

## Part 2 - Computations and Computability
